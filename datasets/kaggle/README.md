# Kaggle Dataset ReadMe

This dataset from Kaggle includes 1.88 million United States wildfires from the years 1992 to 2015. Present as a SQLite database, it contains fires including the following
attributes: unique global identifier, date/time of the fire discovery, statistical cause, date/time of fire containment, fire size (acres), latitude/longitude, and
state/territory code amongst other features. Importantly, these features are primarily geospatial in nature, with no data in areas such as climate/weather, vegetation, etc.

The code for the classification deep learning lies in `try_ml.py` and the code for the regression deep learning is in `try_ml_regression.py`.
