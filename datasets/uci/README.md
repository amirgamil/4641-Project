# UCI Dataset Readme
This dataset consists of wildfire data from 2000 to 2003 in Montesinho National Park in northeast Portugal. It is present as a CSV-type file and consists of 517 entries with 13 
features, including spatial coordinates within the park, month, day, temperature, humidity, rain, and area (in hectares). Due to the multitude of diverse features, dimensionality
reduction and feature selection is important when working with this dataset. Analyses using this source of data should follow a regression model predicting the output variable
(area).
